- ✅ Maintain all existing functionality:
  - Product catalog with filtering and sorting
  - Shopping cart with add/remove/quantity management
  - AI-powered scent discovery (mock implementation)
  - Scent quiz feature
  - Responsive design
  - Arabic branding support

## Technical Stack
- Next.js 15+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React hooks for state management
- Google Fonts integration
- Responsive design patterns

## Implementation Steps

4. Configure Tailwind CSS custom styles

### Phase 2: Component Architecture
1. Create reusable UI components:
   - Header with navigation
   - Hero section
   - Product card component
   - Modal components (AI discovery, quiz, cart)
   - Footer component
2. Implement TypeScript interfaces for data structures

### Phase 3: Core Functionality
1. Product catalog system:
   - Product data structure

   - Sorting functionality (price, name)
   - Product display with animations
2. Shopping cart system:
   - Add/remove products
   - Quantity management
   - Cart persistence (localStorage)
   - Floating cart icon with item count
   - Side panel cart display

### Phase 4: Interactive Features
1. AI Scent Discovery:
